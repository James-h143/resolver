Conf Files should be named "<Your Username>.conf".

ideally create them through the resolver application itself, however you can 
manually create one by just creating a file with the above naming convention.
The contents will need to be exactly as follows (excluding file start and end):
<----File Start---->
PrimaryDNS: int.int.int.int
SecondaryDNS: int.int.int.int
<----File End------>
